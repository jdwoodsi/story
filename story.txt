I was travelling through Raesfeld when I came across an abandoned factory.

Nearby, a dog was lounging in a Porsche parked by the beer garden.

This scene, albeit quite alarming, caught little attention from me as I noticed in front of me a delicious looking doener.

I could smell fresh brot coming from a nearby Baeckerei.

Around the corner was the Flughafen, hearing all the airplanes takeoff.

As I was strolling in the shade of the Schloss, I saw people enjoying their Mehlehase. 

There were also many gebaecks people were enjoying as well!

After seeing so many people eating Gebaecks, I had to find the Baeckerie to get one myself!

I walked inside the bakery and saw twins each wearing a Dirndl. 

After I acnkowledged their beauty, my stomach reminded me why I entered the bakery. I decided to order a Apfelkuchen which looked amazing.

I take my food to go and decide to head over to the biergarten and watch as a couple hunds run around.

Some of the hunds looks a bit thin, so I buy some bratwurts being sold in the biergarten and share it with them.
